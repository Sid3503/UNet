## Introduction to Image Segmentation <a name="introduction"></a>

Image segmentation is the process of dividing an image into segments or regions that correspond to different objects or parts of objects. Unlike classification, which assigns a label to an entire image, segmentation assigns a label to every pixel in the image. This is particularly useful in medical imaging, where identifying specific tissues or anomalies is essential.

## Understanding U-Net Architecture

U-Net is named for its U-shaped architecture, which consists of a contracting path (encoder) and an expansive path (decoder). The architecture allows the network to capture context and spatial information effectively.

### Why U-Net?

- **Precision**: U-Net is designed to work with very few training images and still yield precise segmentation.
- **Efficiency**: The use of skip connections helps in retaining spatial information, making the model efficient in localizing features.

## Key Components of U-Net

### 1. Contracting Path (Encoder)

The contracting path is responsible for capturing the context in the image. It consists of repeated applications of convolutions, followed by a max pooling operation. This process reduces the spatial dimensions while increasing the depth of the feature maps.

- **Example**: Imagine shrinking an image to focus on important features, like edges or textures, while discarding less important details.

### 2. Expansive Path (Decoder)

The expansive path is responsible for enabling precise localization using transposed convolutions. It combines features from the contracting path via skip connections to reconstruct the segmentation map.

- **Example**: Think of zooming back into the image but with added knowledge of what features are important, allowing you to accurately label each pixel.

### 3. Skip Connections

Skip connections are a crucial part of U-Net. They connect layers in the contracting path to the expansive path, allowing the network to recover spatial information lost during downsampling.

- **Example**: If you're drawing a detailed map, you might refer back to a rough sketch to ensure you don't miss any important landmarks.

## How U-Net Works

1. **Input Image**: The network takes an input image, such as a medical scan or a photograph.
2. **Contracting Path**: The image is passed through several layers, each extracting features and reducing the spatial dimensions.
3. **Bottleneck**: At the deepest layer, the network has a compressed representation of the image.
4. **Expansive Path**: The network then upsamples this representation, combining it with features from the contracting path to produce a segmentation map.
5. **Output**: The final output is a segmented image where each pixel is labeled according to its class.

### Visual Example

Imagine you have an image of a cell, and you want to segment the nucleus:

- **Input**: An image of a cell.
- **Contracting Path**: The network identifies edges and textures, reducing the image to its essential features.
- **Expansive Path**: The network reconstructs the image, using the identified features to accurately label each pixel as part of the nucleus or background.
- **Output**: A segmented image where the nucleus is highlighted.

## Results

After 50 epochs of training:
- **Training Accuracy**: ~75%.
- **Validation Accuracy**: ~73%.
- **Test Accuracy**: ~72.7%.
